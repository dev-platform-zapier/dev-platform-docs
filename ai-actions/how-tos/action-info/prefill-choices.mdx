title: Get prefill choices
openapi: post /api/v2/apps/{app}/choices/{prefill}/
---

If a need that comes back from the [Get Action Details](/ai-actions/how-tos/action-info/action-details) endpoint has a `prefill` key, then this endpoint can be used to get the choices for that prefill.

## Dependent needs

If a need has any values in its `depends_on` array, the values for each of the needs in `depends_on` _must_ be included in the `params` in the body of the `POST` to get prefill choices.

As an example, the `action_needs` list for the `add_row` action for the `GoogleSheetsV2API` app from [Get action details and needs](/ai-actions/how-tos/action-info/action-details) includes a `spreadsheet` and a `worksheet` need:

```json
{
  "action_needs": [
    {
      "key": "spreadsheet",
      "label": "Spreadsheet",
      "prefill": "spreadsheet.id.title",
      "depends_on": []
    },
    {
      "key": "worksheet",
      "label": "Worksheet",
      "prefill": "worksheet.id.title",
      "depends_on": ["spreadsheet"]
    }
  ]
}
```

This means that, in order to get the `worksheet.id.title` prefill choices, you need to include a `spreadsheet` value in the request to this endpoint:

```json
{
  "params": { "spreadsheet": "SOME_SPREADHSEET_ID" }
}
```

`SOME_SPREADHSEET_ID` would have come from a call to get prefill choices for the `spreadsheet.id.title` value.

## Caching

By default, responses from this endpoint for a given `app`, `prefill`, `params`, and user will be cached for 24 hours.

When this endpoint is first hit, a background job is started that will paginate through all of the available choices.

While this background job is running, the results from this endpoint will return with `"is_loading": true`.

If `is_loading` is `true`, then the endpoint should be polled every ~1 second until `is_loading` is `false`, at which point all of the available results are returned.

The time that the cache was last updated is returned with `last_refresh_seconds_ago`.

To force a refresh of the cache, the `force_refresh` query parameter can be set to `true`.

<Warning>
`force_refresh` should only be used when the choices are expected to have changed, and should only be used with a single request.

Repeated reqeusts with `force_refresh` set to `true` will cause results to continuously load.

</Warning>
