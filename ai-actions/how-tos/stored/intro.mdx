        Actions need to be configured by a user before they can be used.

        There are two ways to set up stored actions:
        1. Using the AI Actions website- see [Configure stored actions](/ai-actions/how-tos/stored/action-configuration) for more details.
        2. Using the AI Action management API provided under [Manage stored actions](/ai-actions/how-tos/stored/manage/create-action).

        After actions are set up, they can be provided as tools to an LLM.

        See [List stored Actions](/ai-actions/how-tos/stored/list-actions) for more details.
    </Step>
    <Step stepNumber={3} title="Run the action" titleSize="h3">
