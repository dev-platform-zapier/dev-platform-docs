title: Authentication
openapi: get /api/v2/auth/check/

# Introduction

There are two methods that can be used to authenticate with `@zapier/ai-actions`:

- [API Key](#api-key): If you plan on only using the AI Actions client to interact with AI Actions on your behalf
- [OAuth](#oauth): If you plan on creating an OAuth app to allow users to interact with AI Actions on their behalf

<Tip>
  If you plan on using the interactive playground available in this
  documentation, then an API key must be user.
</Tip>

## API Key

Follow the steps below to create your API key:

1. [Log in](https://actions.zapier.com/custom/start/) or [sign up](https://zapier.com/sign-up) to Zapier.
2. [Connect](https://actions.zapier.com/custom/actions/) your Zapier account to the `custom` integration app.
3. Your API key can be retrieved from the [Credentials page](https://actions.zapier.com/credentials/).

<Warning>
**Treat your API key like a password.**

It can be used to run your AI Actions.

For example: if you set up a "Gmail: Find email" action, anyone with your API key can read all your email.

</Warning>

## OAuth

### Creating an OAuth app

  Click here to create a new OAuth app to use for authenticating with AI
  Actions.
  <Warning>
    In order to work with the `@zapier/ai-actions` API client, **your app must
    have "Public Client" checked.**
  </Warning>
</Card>

### Authenticating with OAuth

<Tip>
If you're using JavaScript/TypeScript, you can use the `@zapier/ai-actions` library to handle authentication for you!

[See the `@zapier/ai-actions` documentation here](/ai-actions/libraries/nodejs/authentication#getting-an-oauth-token)

</Tip>

### Getting a token

Your OAuth client can be used with the [PKCE flow](https://www.oauth.com/playground/authorization-code-with-pkce.html) to authenticate with AI Actions using a `Bearer` token.

To begin this process, you first need to generate a code verifier and a code challenge.

Here is some sample code in TypeScript to do this:

```ts
/*
 * https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#cryptogetrandomvaluestypedarray
 *
 * Store the verifier securely, as it will be needed later
 *
 * @returns Verifier to use when getting a token
 */
const generateVerifier = () => {
  const array = new Uint32Array(28);
  crypto.getRandomValues(array);

  return Array.from(array, (item) => `0${item.toString(16)}`.slice(-2)).join(
    ""
  );
};

/** Base64 URL encode a buffer */
const base64URLEncode = (buffer: ArrayBuffer) => {
  const uint8Array = new Uint8Array(buffer);
  const base64String = btoa(String.fromCharCode(...uint8Array));
  return base64String
    .replace(/\+/g, "-")
    .replace(/\//g, "_")
    .replace(/=+$/, "");
};

/**
 * @param verifier Verifier from `generateVerifier`
 * @returns Base64 URL encoded SHA-256 hash of the verifier
 */
const generateCodeChallenge = async (verifier: string) => {
  const encoder = new TextEncoder();
  const data = encoder.encode(verifier);
  const hashBuffer = await crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-256", data);
  return base64URLEncode(hashBuffer);
};
```

<Warning>
  Make sure to store the verifier securely! It will be needed when returning to
  your site after authenticating with AI Actions
</Warning>

You can then send the user to AI Actions to see your OAuth consent screen:

```
https://actions.zapier.com/oauth/authorize?
  client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&
  redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&
  scope=openid%20nla%3Aexposed_actions%3Aexecute&
  response_type=code&
  code_challenge=YOUR_CODE_CHALLENGE&
  code_challenge_method=S256
```

After the user has authorized your app, they will be redirected to the `redirect_uri` you provided with a `code` query parameter.

You can then exchange this code for a token, using the `verifier` that you generated previously:

```sh
curl -X POST "https://actions.zapier.com/oauth/token/" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     --data-urlencode "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID" \
     --data-urlencode "grant_type=authorization_code" \
     --data-urlencode "code_verifier=YOUR_VERIFIER" \
     --data-urlencode "redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI" \
     --data-urlencode "code=YOUR_CODE"
```

This will return the following JSON:

```ts
interface OAuthAccessToken {
  /** JWT with user info */
  id_token: string;

  /** Token that can be used with the `Authorization: Bearer ...` header */
  access_token: string;

  /** Token that can be used to get a new access token */
  refresh_token: string;

  /** Number of seconds until the token expires */
  expires_in: number;

  token_type: "Bearer";
  scope: "openid nla:exposed_actions:execute";
}
```

The `access_token` can then be used to make API calls to AI Actions:

```sh
curl -X GET "https://actions.zapier.com/api/v2/auth/check" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### Quick account creation

Since your users may not already have a Zapier account, we offer a quick account creation flow that allows users to create a Zapier account and connect their account to your app in one step.

To use this flow, first generate the `/oauth/authorize` URL as outlined above.

Then, get the account creation URL for your OAuth client:

```sh
https://actions.zapier.com/api/v2/auth/login-link/?
  redirect_uri=OAUTH_AUTHORIZE_URL&
  sign_up_first_name=USER_FIRST_NAME&
  sign_up_last_name=USER_LAST_NAME&
  sign_up_email=USER_EMAIL
```

This will return the following JSON:

```ts
{
  "login_link": "https://zapier.com/....."
}
```

When you send a user to the provided `login_link`, they will go through a quick Zapier account creation flow. If the provided email address is already associated with a Zapier account, they will be asked to log in.
Users will receive a follow-up email from Zapier to confirm their email address and to let them set a password for the account.

The user will then see the AI Actions OAuth consent screen and be redirected back to your `redirect_uri` with a `code` query parameter, which can be exchanged for an access token as outlined above.

### Refreshing tokens

After `expires_in` seconds, the `access_token` will expire. To get a new token, you can use the `refresh_token` that was returned when you got the original token:

```sh
curl -X POST "https://actions.zapier.com/oauth/token/" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     --data-urlencode "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID" \
     --data-urlencode "grant_type=refresh_token" \
     --data-urlencode "refresh_token=YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"
```

This will return a new OAuth token that can be used in an `Authorization: Bearer ...` header.
