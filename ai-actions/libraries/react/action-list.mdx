title: ActionList
---

The `ActionList` component can be used to list all of the current [stored actions](/ai-actions/how-tos/stored/intro) that are available for a user.

If you are using an API key for authentication, then the stored actions listed will be only for that API Key.

If you are using OAuth for authentication, then the stored actions listed will only be the actions that a user has set up for your OAuth provider.

## Props

### `onActionSelected`

This is called when the user clicks on an action in the list. It is passed the `AiAction` object that was clicked.

See the [List stored actions](/ai-actions/how-tos/stored/list-actions) documentation for more information about what this object contains.

## Usage

<Warning>
  Make sure that this component is rendered unerneath an
  [`AiActionsProvider`](/ai-actions/libraries/react/ai-actions-provider)!
