<Note>
### **The `@zapier/ai-actions-react` package is still in development!**

If you want to check it out, please [contact us](https://nla.zapier.app/_z/embed/page/clh5sdteo0001ml0pdz8a2aqr?&)

</Note>

The `@zapier/ai-actions-react` library provides utilities to make it easy to interact with AI Actions from a React application.

## Installation

To install the library, run:

```bash
# npm
npm install @zapier/ai-actions @zapier/ai-actions-react

# pnpm
pnpm add @zapier/ai-actions @zapier/ai-actions-react

# yarn
yarn add @zapier/ai-actions @zapier/ai-actions-react
```

## Quick start

[Get your API Key here](https://actions.zapier.com/credentials/)

Render the `AiActionsProvider` at the root of your application, or around any components that need to interact with AI Actions.

You can pass the API key as a prop to the provider component, or you can get an OAuth token. See the [Authentication guide](/ai-actions/libraries/nodejs/authentication) for more information.

```tsx
import { AiActionsProvider } from "@zapier/ai-actions-react";

export const MyAiActionsProvider = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <AiActionsProvider
      auth={{
        apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",

        // or, if you have an OAuth token...
        // token: "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </AiActionsProvider>
  );
};
```

<Warning>
  If you're using a framework like Next.js, the `AiActionsProvider` and the
  components rendered as children of it need to be rendered client-side.

This can be done by putting `"use client";` at the top of the file that uses `AiActionsProvider`.

</Warning>

Then, you can use the `ActionList` component to list the actions that are available to the user:

```tsx
import { AiAction } from "@zapier/ai-actions";
import { ActionList } from "@zapier/ai-actions-react";

export const AiActionList = () => {
  // When the user clicks on an action in the list, the `onActionSelected` callback will be called.
  // This can be used to open a modal to edit the action, or to execute it using the `AiActions` client.
  return <ActionList onActionSelected={(action) => console.log(action)} />;
};
```
