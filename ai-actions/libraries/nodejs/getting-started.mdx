If you want to check it out, please [contact us](https://nla.zapier.app/_z/embed/page/clh5sdteo0001ml0pdz8a2aqr?&)

</Note>

The `@zapier/ai-actions` library makes it easy to interact with AI Actions from the client or the server.

The library includes an API client, Typescript types, and utilities to make authentication easy.

## Installation

To install the library, run:

```bash
# npm
npm install @zapier/ai-actions

# pnpm
pnpm add @zapier/ai-actions

# yarn
yarn add @zapier/ai-actions
```

## Quick start

[Get your API Key here](https://actions.zapier.com/credentials/)

Create a new `AiActions` client with your API key:

```ts
import { AiActions } from "@zapier/ai-actions";

const aiActionsClient = new AiActions({
  auth: {
    apiKey: "sk-YOUR_API_KEY",
  },
});
```

Use the client:

```ts
const actionList = await aiActionsClient.getActionList();

actionList.results.forEach((action) => {
  console.log(action.id, action.description);
});
```
