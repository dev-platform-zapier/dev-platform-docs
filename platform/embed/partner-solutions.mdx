Our partner solutions are the easiest ways to embed Zapier and surface integrations within your product. Check out the [Partner Solutions documentation](/partner-solutions/getting-started) to learn about [plug-and-play elements](/partner-solutions/workflow-element/intro), the [Workflow API](/partner-solutions/api-reference/authentication), [quick account creation](/partner-solutions/quick-account-creation), and more.

Zapier's partner solutions are available for public integrations. To take advantage of our embed solution, first ensure your integration has been published to [Zapier's App Directory](https://zapier.com/apps). If your integration isn't yet published, learn more about [submitting your integration for review](/platform/publish/public-integration#4-submit-your-integration-for-app-review).
